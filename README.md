**FROZEN**: Presents an innovative approach to extending the few-shot learning capabilities of pre-existing language models into the multimodal domain, specifically targeting the integration of visual and linguistic elements without the need to alter the foundational language model parameters. This methodology introduces a vision encoder, specifically an **NF-ResNet-50**, designed to translate images into a continuous sequence of embeddings. These embeddings serve as a visual prefix to the input for a pre-trained autoregressive language model based on the Transformer architecture, enabling the language model to process and generate content relevant to the given visual context. The core innovation lies in the system's modularity, achieved by keeping the language model's weights static while **only updating the vision encoder** during training. This approach leverages the Conceptual Captions dataset, focusing on the alignment of image-caption pairs to train the vision encoder, thereby simplifying the integration of visual data into language models. The architecture of FROZEN is distinguished by its use of a dynamic visual prefix, a departure from the conventional static text prompts typical in prefix tuning. This dynamic prefix is achieved by linearly mapping and reshaping the vision encoder's output into a sequence of embeddings, mirroring the functionality of text-based prefix tokens in traditional language model tuning. This mechanism allows the model to adapt more fluidly to multimodal inputs, enhancing its ability to interpret and generate language that is contextually aligned with visual data. The employment of a dynamic visual prefix is a key factor in FROZEN's ability to improve task performance across multimodal settings through in-context learning, providing a novel solution to the challenge of incorporating visual information into the language generation process. The utilization of the Conceptual Captions dataset is central to FROZEN's training methodology, enabling the **vision encoder to adeptly convert images** into a format that the language model can process. This dataset serves the dual purpose of enhancing the model's understanding of visual content and its associated linguistic descriptions, thereby facilitating the generation of accurate and contextually relevant captions. The strategic combination of a static language model with a trainable vision encoder encapsulates FROZEN's approach to multimodal few-shot learning, offering a streamlined and effective pathway to integrating visual data into linguistic models.

However, its performance escalates with the scale of training, showcasing its potential to outperform traditional CNN approaches through extensive pre-training on large datasets. This process highlights the critical role of dataset selection in ViT's training regimen. It is fine-tuned on smaller datasets following a comprehensive pre-training phase that leverages large datasets like ImageNet-21k and JFT-300M to enhance model generalization and performance across a wide range of tasks. The datasets employed, including ImageNet, CIFAR-100, VTAB, ImageNet-21k, and JFT-300M, serve dual purposes: benchmarking the model's image classification capabilities and evaluating its transferability to diverse tasks with limited data, thereby establishing ViT's versatility and effectiveness in advancing image recognition tasks.
